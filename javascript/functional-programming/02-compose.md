# Custom errors, extending Error

When we develop something, we often need our own error classes to reflect specific things that may go wrong in our tasks. For errors in network operations we may need `HttpError`, for database operations `DbError`, for searching operations `NotFoundError` and so on.

Our errors should support basic error properties like `message`, `name` and, preferably, `stack`. But they also may have other properties of their own, e.g. `HttpError` objects may have a `statusCode` property with a value like `404` or `403` or `500`.

JavaScript allows to use `throw` with any argument, so technically our custom error classes don't need to inherit from `Error`. But if we inherit, then it becomes possible to use `obj instanceof Error` to identify error objects. So it's better to inherit from it.

As the application grows, our own errors naturally form a hierarchy. For instance, `HttpTimeoutError` may inherit from `HttpError`, and so on.

## Extending Error

As an example, let's consider a function `readUser(json)` that should read JSON with user data.

Here's an example of how a valid `json` may look:
```js
let json = `{ "name": "John", "age": 30 }`;
```

Internally, we'll use `JSON.parse`. If it receives malformed `json`, then it throws `SyntaxError`. But even if `json` is syntactically correct, that doesn't mean that it's a valid user, right? It may miss the necessary data. For instance, it may not have `name` and `age` properties that are essential for our users.
